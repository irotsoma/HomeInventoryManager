# Home Inventory Manager

Originally created for a school project but extending for my own use as well.  This application is designed to allow the user to create an inventory of valuable items in their home(s) for insurance purposes. It generates some basic reports which will be expanded in the future.

Installation and user guide are located in the docs folder.
